# flower-classification
This is a Machine Learning model built using Tensorflow frame work
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) algorithm is used
CNN is built using Keras
Here it takes an iput of image from local library or Webcam
For this,Gradio is used to create a GUI
output predicts the image into 5 predefined classes

# flower-classification
This is a Machine Learning model built using TensorFlow frame work.\
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) algorithm is used for image classification.\
CNN is built using sequential class of Keras.\
Here it takes an iput of image from local library or Webcam.\
For this,Gradio is used to create a GUI.\
output predicts the image into 5 predefined classes.\

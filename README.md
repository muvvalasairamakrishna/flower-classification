# flower-classification
This is a Machine Learning model built using TensorFlow frame work.\
\nConvolutional Neural Network(CNN) algorithm is used for image classification.\
\nCNN is built using sequential class of Keras.\
\nHere it takes an iput of image from local library or Webcam.\
\nFor this,Gradio is used to create a GUI.\
\noutput predicts the image into 5 predefined classes.\
